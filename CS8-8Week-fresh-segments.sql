-- 5. Provide a possible reason why the max average composition might change from month to month? 
	-- Could it signal something is not quite right with the overall business model for Fresh Segments?
/*	
ANS
One possible reason based on the previous question is seasonal change. Based on the result, customer interaction on content related to travel/holiday is relatively higher than the other, 
especially during the holiday season or the end of the year. Because of this, the interaction on contents that are other than travel/holiday would be lower outside the holiday season.
