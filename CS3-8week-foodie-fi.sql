------------------ B. Data Analysis Questions-----------------------------

-- 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

	Count(distinct customer_id) 
FROM 
	Subscriptions

-- 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

SELECT 
	Extract(Month from start_date) as _Month, Count(Extract(Month from start_date)) 
FROM 
	subscriptions
WHERE 
	plan_id = 0

								FROM subscriptions) as Percent 
From 
	subscriptions
WHERE 
	PLAN_ID = 4
GROUP BY
	PLAN_ID

-- 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?

WITH CTE AS(
	SELECT 
		CUSTOMER_ID,
		PLAN_ID, 
		LAG(PLAN_ID) OVER (PARTITION BY CUSTOMER_ID ORDER BY PLAN_ID) PREV
	FROM

-- 8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?

count(*) AS no_of_times
FROM diff
GROUP BY 30 * FLOOR(datediff/ 30), 30 * (FLOOR(datediff / 30) + 1)
ORDER BY MIN(datediff);

-- 11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?

WITH CTE AS(
	SELECT 
		CUSTOMER_ID,
		PLAN_ID,
		START_DATE, 
		LEAD(PLAN_ID) OVER (PARTITION BY CUSTOMER_ID) AS NEXT_PLAN
	FROM

FROM 
	CTE
WHERE 
	PLAN_ID = 2 AND NEXT_PLAN = 1 AND START_DATE BETWEEN '01-01-2020' AND '31-12-2020'

SELECT * FROM PLANS

--------------------- C. Challenge Payment Question---------------------------------

/*
The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

-monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
-upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
-upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
-once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

-- D. Outside The Box Questions

-- How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?

-- What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?
	
	-- No of customer month by month
	-- How many customers buy the plan after trial ends
	-- Why are customers ending subscription
	-- Financial growth and costs


-- What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?

	-- How many customers buy the plan after trial ends
	-- How many buy the annual plan (as it shows their commitment)
	-- reason of churning
	-- Are the customers feeling the subscriptions worth it
	
-- If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?

	--Why are you ending the subscriptions?
	-- Where can we improve in User Experience?
	-- How would you rate our content?
	-- Would you again be our customer?
	
-- What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?

	-- Make more content which is liked by the audience
	-- Ask for rating which will help in knowing customer interest
	-- Have a referral programme which incentivizes the customer
	-- Provide them offers after few months of churn
